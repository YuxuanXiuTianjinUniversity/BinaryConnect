Hello Sir !
I am Yuxuan Xiu from a university in China and I am trying to reproduce your experimental results on Windows10 
with the newest version of theano. I came with several errors and solved them. Maybe there are several changes which should be made
to run BinaryConnect with the newest version of theano ?
[1] As the newest version of theano changed  "signal.downsample.max_pool_2d", line 415 in layer.py should be changed to 
"z = T.signal.pool.pool_2d(input=z, ds=self.pool_shape, st=self.pool_stride, mode='max')"
...I hope I am right...
[2]I came with a problem between "float32" and "float64" and this finally worked
Chnage line 272 to 276 in trainer.py to:
        self.shared_x.set_value(float32(set.X[start:(size+start)]))
        self.shared_y.set_value(float32(set.y[start:(size+start)]))
Maybe adding float32 to it can me the program stronger?

Sorry, I never used github like this before and as you notice my Engish is not very good...Maybe an E-mail is better but I am affraid
that I may disturb you...
